# Fedora's Economy
###### Built for `Sponge 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT`, and off of `JDK 1.8.0_71`.

An Economy plugin, now in beta, which implements the Economy API provided by Sponge!

#####Features Multi-Currency with config files! YAY.

## Big thanks to a couple of people.
 - God, for creating this awesome place to live in, and for giving me the time and talents to create this. All glory to him.
 - The SpongePowered team for making their API (including all their contributors)
 - And the SpongeDocs team, for making it easy to learn!
 - Flibio for making EconomyLITE, and licensing it under the MIT license. I learned the basics of filling out this API thanks to you.
 - hsyyid for having examples for the Configuration stuff in your also-MIT-licensed code

I could'nt have made this without you. <3

Enjoy!
